/*
 * PuTTY's own reimplementation of DialogBox() and EndDialog() which
 * provide extra capabilities.
 *
 * Originally introduced in 2003 to work around a problem with our
 * message loops, in which keystrokes pressed in the 'Change Settings'
 * dialog in mid-session would _also_ be delivered to the main
 * terminal window.
 *
 * But once we had our own wrapper it was convenient to put further
 * things into it. In particular, this system allows you to provide a
 * context pointer at setup time that's easy to retrieve from the
 * window procedure.
